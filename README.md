# hello-word

Hi humans!

Jude here, i just landed from the moon, to this lovely planet github. 
I like Javascript, node.js, react.js, and anything about script.
I just want to work with all this things with a cup of coffee and a visa to the web and access to the cloud.
I hope to develop open source projects to develop the internet of things...#IoT!!!
